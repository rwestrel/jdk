This needs to be configured with 

--with-jvm-variants=leyden

and then can be built with:

make hotspot

Only building of the JVM is supported. Only debug builds were tested.

As part of this experiment, required components are excluded from the
build and not replaced. As a consequence, the resulting build can't be
run.
